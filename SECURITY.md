## Introduction

Horizor App is committed to maintaining the integrity and security of our systems, data, and the trust of our users. We recognize the importance of collaboration with our community and security researchers to continuously improve our security measures. This policy outlines our approach to data handling, secure practices, and vulnerability disclosure.

## I. Third-Party Data Usage Policy

We ensure that all third-party libraries and integrations used in our platform adhere to strict data usage and privacy standards. Our protocols include:

- **Rigorous Vetting**: Thorough evaluation of third-party services to confirm compliance with our data usage policies.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing assessment of third-party practices to ensure they remain aligned with our standards.
- **Immediate Action**: Swift mitigation of risks if a third-party service deviates from agreed-upon practices.

## II. Annual Penetration Testing (Pentest)

To maintain a robust security posture, Horizor App conducts:

- **Annual Penetration Testing**: Performed by an independent, certified third party to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- **Prioritization of Issues**: Immediate action on critical vulnerabilities, followed by a structured plan to address other findings.
- **Transparency**: Sharing key learnings and improvements with relevant stakeholders.

## III. Vulnerability Reporting and Management

Please refrain from engaging in physical security attacks, social engineering, distributed denial of service (DDoS), spam, or targeting third-party applications.
